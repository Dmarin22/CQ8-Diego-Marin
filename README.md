Staircase

Time Complexity:

There are two nested for loops each running up to n times because of this the time complexity is O(n^2)

Space Complexity:

The space complexity is O(1) because the solutions uses constant time no matter the input size since it only uses one variable


Alternating Characters:

Recursion:

Time Complexity:

Space Complexity:
